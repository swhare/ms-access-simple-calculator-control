# MS Access: Simple Calculator Control
Contains a form containing controls that mimick a simple calculator.  This can be implemented as a dialog using VBA allowing both the evaluation string and the answer to be captured.  Capturing the evaluation string can be helpful for auditing purposes.  This form duplicates the functionality of the calculator control that appeared in much earlier versions of Microsoft Access, but have long since been discontinued.

After making a calculation, simply press the enter key (or equals button) a second time to close the form, and commit the data it contians.  This feature is designed to promote fast data entry.

An example form is included that shows how the calculator form might be called easily from within another form.  Opening the form can, of course, be tied to other events like a keypress, double-click, etc.

If you decide to incorporate this into your database project, all I ask for is credit wherever a substantial portion of this dialog is used.
